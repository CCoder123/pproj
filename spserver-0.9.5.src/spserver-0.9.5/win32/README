			 spserver/win32 README

spserver/win32 is a TCP server framework library written in C++ based on IOCP.

SP_IocpServer implements the Half-Sync/Half-Async pattern. It uses a single
thread to process IO (the async layer), and a thread pool to process the service
logic (the sync layer, the long time duration work can be done here).

SP_IocpLFServer implements the Leader/Follower pattern.

SP_IocpDispatcher designs to apply a half-async/half-sync thread pool for both
server and client sockets.



You can get the code from the spserver home page:

Any and all comments are appreciated.

Enjoy!
